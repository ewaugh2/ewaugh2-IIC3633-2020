# Combining Predictions for Accurate Recommender Systems

## Introduction

In the paper presented by Michael Jahrer, Andreas TÃ¶scher and Robert Legenstein (2010), the authors present different Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms that can be used to build recommendation systems and perform predictions for that task, then they present several algorithms used for blending. The authors then test the blending algorithms, using the CF algorithms presented before, in the Netflix price dataset. Finally they draw and present conclusions from the performed work.

## Comments

I find interesting that this type of work that attemps to study the blended performance of different methods for solving a problem is not more common. The potential of blended systems is Max(X1,...,Xn), where Xi is a single method for solving the problem.

Is also interesting to see the results, that, as expected, outperform every single method, and that ensembling the methods for blending predictions outperforms a single blending algorithm.

## Conclusion

It would be very interesting to see a similar work done with current algorithms. This blending and ensembling task should be performed periodically to improve the "current" technologies to solve problems in all areas of computer science, as it has the potential to maximize the performance of the "current" methods, methods that may even be complementary on some aspects.

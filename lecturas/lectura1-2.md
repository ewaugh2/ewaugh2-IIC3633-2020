# Funk SVD

Standing for Single Value Decomposition, this post shows a statistical method to solve the Netflix price competition in which it came third place at the time. Compared to the other weekly reading paper this one is more informal and less rigorous in it's findings so it's a little less didactic, although more fun to read.

One strangth of the presented logic is that it's very practical. It uses practical findings to advance in the development of the method, but there lies the weakness of it too. Although it's practical, is less replicable in different problems, so it could be more difficult to extract general principles and apply them to similar or complitly different problems. Disclaimer: I did not try to replicate the method to any problem.

I dont't have much more to say about the post. It was fun to read, didactic and a display of pragmatism in problem solving and solution development. It was filled with C code instead of mathematical expressions (which could be a positive thing to some, but not much to poeple not familiar with the programming language).
